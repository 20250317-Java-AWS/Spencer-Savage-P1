# XKCD Viewer Application
This Angular application allows users to browse XKCD comics by fetching data from the XKCD API. Users can navigate between comics and view details such as the comic's title, number, and alt text. Users can also select specific comics using an input field. 

The application leverages Angular's routing for navigation. RxJS is used for handling API requests. It is designed with a responsive UI using Bootstrap for seamless user experience across devices.
